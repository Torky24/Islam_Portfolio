* First project entails my bachelor's thesis (Python)
* Second project is the game of life with a GUI (Java)

# Project 1 (Bachelor's Thesis as well as two publications): Project Overview
* Data is of several masonry walls, and steel girts under the effect of explosions.
* Cleaned the data and used it to apply multiple learning algorithms. (In this repisotory only the ANN is available)
* Scaled data accordingly.
* Used Monte Carlo method to predict P - I diagrams.
* P - I diagrams could potentially be used to assist engineers to design walls that could withstand certain explosions. Potentially saving lives.
* Both publications are in PDF format.
