# Islam Torky Portfolio
* Project 1 entails my bachelor's thesis (Python)
* Project 2 is the game of life with a GUI (Java)

# [Project 1 (Bachelor's Thesis as well as two publications): Project Overview] https://github.com/Torky24/Islam_Portfolio/blob/main/P-I%20Diagram%20ANN.py
* Data is of several masonry walls, and steel girts under the effect of explosions.
* Cleaned the data and used it to apply multiple learning algorithms. (In this repisotory only the ANN is available)
* Scaled data accordingly.
* Used Monte Carlo method to predict P - I diagrams.
* P - I diagrams could potentially be used to assist engineers to design walls that could withstand certain explosions. Potentially saving lives.
* ANN yielded the best test accuracy.
* Only train/dev set, not train/dev/test since the dataset was too small.
* Both publications are in PDF format.


# Project 2 (Part of Object Oriented Programming Master's Course) Game Of Life: Project Overview
* Creating and developing game of life on Java.
* Using OOP methods, to avoid sphagetti code.
* Well documented.
